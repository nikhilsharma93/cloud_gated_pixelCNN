# cloud_gated_pixelCNN
Extension of the Gated-Pixel CNN architecture (https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05328) to removal of clouds from aerial imagery

For training on the CIFAR-10 dataset, execute "qlua run.lua -b <batch-size> -r <initial learning rate> -o <save directory path> -m <momentum, if used>

*Exension to clouds is under construction (via adaptive masking)*
